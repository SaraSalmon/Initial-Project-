## Classification of CT Images for Lung Cancer Diagnosis/Prevention

### Project Overview

This repository contains the first phase of the project aimed at classifying CT images for the diagnosis and prevention of lung cancer. The objective of this initial phase is to gather as many images as possible and utilize Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to subsequently train the model.

### Objectives

- **Image Collection**: The primary goal of this phase is to collect a diverse dataset of CT images related to lung cancer. This data will serve as the foundation for developing a robust classification model.
  
- **Utilizing Advanced Techniques**: We aim to leverage Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques for image analysis, which will enable us to create a model capable of identifying and diagnosing lung cancer effectively.

### Image Gathering Techniques

To compile the dataset, we have employed various techniques, including:

- **Web Scraping**: Automated scripts have been utilized to extract relevant images from various online resources.
  
- **API Utilization**: We have accessed images through APIs from reputable sources, including:
  - **Cancer Imaging Archive**
  - **KAGGLE - NIH Chest X-rays**
  - **NIH - PubMed Central**
  - **NIH - National Library of Medicine**

### Documents Included

This repository contains four documents that provide detailed insights into the methods, data sources, and processes involved in the image collection phase of the project.

1. **Document 1**: Code for obtaining images from the Cancer Imaging Archive API.
2. **Document 2**: Code for retrieving images from the KAGGLE API for the NIH Chest X-rays dataset, filtered by tags using the metadata document.
3. **Document 3**: Web scraping code for extracting images from a PubMed Central article on lung cancer.
4. **Document 4**: Web scraping code for collecting 100 images from the first page of the National Library of Medicine.

### Future Work

Following the image collection, the next phase will involve preprocessing the gathered images, followed by the implementation of machine learning algorithms for model training and validation. 

### Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the data sources and tools that have made this project possible. Their contributions are invaluable for advancing research in lung cancer diagnosis and prevention.
